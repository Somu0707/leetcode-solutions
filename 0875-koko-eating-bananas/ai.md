## 💭 Thought Process

To solve this problem, let's start by thinking about what happens at different eating speeds:

1. **Brute Force Idea**: 
   We could try every possible eating speed $k$, starting from $k = 1$ and going up to the size of the largest pile ($\max(\text{piles})$). For each speed $k$, we iterate through all piles and calculate the total hours Koko needs to finish them. The first speed $k$ that allows Koko to finish within $h$ hours would be our minimum answer.

2. **Why Brute Force is Inefficient**: 
   The max pile size can be as large as $10^9$. If we linearly test speeds from $1$ to $10^9$, and for each speed we iterate through $N$ piles ($N \le 10^4$), the total operations could be up to $10^{13}$. This will definitely result in a **Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)**.

3. **Key Observation**: 
   Notice the relationship between speed $k$ and total hours required:
   - If Koko eats at a higher speed, the total hours required **decreases or stays the same**.
   - If Koko eats at a lower speed, the total hours required **increases**.

   This monotonic behavior (if speed $k$ is valid, any speed $> k$ is also valid) means we don't need to check every speed linearly. Instead, we can use **Binary Search on Answer** to find the minimal valid speed $k$ efficiently.

## 💡 Intuition

- **Search Space**:
  - Minimum speed `low = 1`: Koko eats at least 1 banana per hour.
  - Maximum speed `high = max(piles)`: Eating faster than the largest pile does not reduce total time below $N$ hours, because Koko can eat at most one pile per hour.

- **Monotonic Feasibility Function**:
  For a candidate speed $k$, calculating the total time required takes $O(N)$ time. Since the answer space is sorted from $1$ to $\max(\text{piles})$, Binary Search allows us to eliminate half of the search space at each step.

- **Ceiling Division Trick**:
  To compute hours taken for a pile of size $p$ at speed $k$, we need $\lceil p / k \rceil$. Using integer arithmetic, this can be written as `(p + k - 1) / k` without needing floating-point operations.

## 🚀 Approach

1. **Initialize Binary Search Range**:
   - Set `low = 1`.
   - Set `high = max(piles)`.

2. **Binary Search for Minimum Speed**:
   - Calculate candidate speed `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.
   - Compute the total hours required to finish all piles at speed `mid`.
   - **If total hours $\le h$**: Speed `mid` is fast enough! Since we want the *minimum* speed, record `mid` as a potential answer and narrow the search range to smaller speeds (`high = mid - 1`).
   - **If total hours $> h$**: Speed `mid` is too slow. Increase the speed range (`low = mid + 1`).

3. **Return Result**:
   - When the search loop finishes, `low` will be pointing to the smallest valid eating speed.

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. Function `calculateTotalHours(piles, speed)`:
   - Initialize `total_hours = 0`.
   - For each `bananas` in `piles`:
     - `total_hours += (bananas + speed - 1) / speed`
   - Return `total_hours`.

2. Function `minEatingSpeed(piles, h)`:
   - Set `low = 1`
   - Set `high = maximum element in piles`
   - While `low <= high`:
     - `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`
     - If `calculateTotalHours(piles, mid) <= h`:
       - `high = mid - 1` (try finding a smaller valid speed)
     - Else:
       - `low = mid + 1` (speed is too slow, increase lower bound)
   - Return `low`

## 🔍 Dry Run

Let's trace the algorithm with an example: `piles = [3, 6, 7, 11]`, `h = 8`

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - `low = 1`, `high = 11` ($\max(3, 6, 7, 11)$)

2. **Iteration 1**:
   - `mid = 1 + (11 - 1) / 2 = 6`
   - Calculate hours at speed $6$:
     - Pile $3 \rightarrow \lceil 3/6 \rceil = 1$ hour
     - Pile $6 \rightarrow \lceil 6/6 \rceil = 1$ hour
     - Pile $7 \rightarrow \lceil 7/6 \rceil = 2$ hours
     - Pile $11 \rightarrow \lceil 11/6 \rceil = 2$ hours
     - Total Hours $= 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6$
   - $6 \le 8$ (Feasible speed $\rightarrow$ try smaller speeds)
   - Update: `high = 6 - 1 = 5`

3. **Iteration 2**:
   - `low = 1`, `high = 5`
   - `mid = 1 + (5 - 1) / 2 = 3`
   - Calculate hours at speed $3$:
     - Pile $3 \rightarrow 1$, Pile $6 \rightarrow 2$, Pile $7 \rightarrow 3$, Pile $11 \rightarrow 4$
     - Total Hours $= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$
   - $10 > 8$ (Too slow $\rightarrow$ need faster speed)
   - Update: `low = 3 + 1 = 4`

4. **Iteration 3**:
   - `low = 4`, `high = 5`
   - `mid = 4 + (5 - 4) / 2 = 4`
   - Calculate hours at speed $4$:
     - Pile $3 \rightarrow 1$, Pile $6 \rightarrow 2$, Pile $7 \rightarrow 2$, Pile $11 \rightarrow 3$
     - Total Hours $= 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8$
   - $8 \le 8$ (Feasible speed $\rightarrow$ try smaller speeds)
   - Update: `high = 4 - 1 = 3`

5. **Termination**:
   - Loop ends since `low (4) > high (3)`.
   - Result: `low = 4`.

## ⚠️ Edge Cases

- **$h = \text{piles.length}$**: Koko has exactly enough hours to eat one pile per hour. She must eat at a speed equal to the largest pile ($\max(\text{piles})$).
- **Integer Overflow**: Total hours accumulated across piles can exceed standard 32-bit integer limits when `piles[i]` and $h$ are large (up to $10^9$). Using a **64-bit integer** (`long long`) for `total_hours` avoids overflow during evaluation.
- **Single Pile Input**: Handled naturally because search boundaries adjust between $1$ and `piles[0]`.

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **$O(N \log M)$**, where $N$ is the number of piles (`piles.length`) and $M$ is the maximum value in `piles` ($\max(\text{piles})$).
- The binary search space ranges from $1$ to $M$, taking $O(\log M)$ iterations.
- In each iteration, calculating total hours requires traversing all $N$ piles, taking $O(N)$ time.

### Space Complexity
- **$O(1)$** auxiliary space.
- Only scalar variables are used for binary search boundaries and sum calculations, consuming constant extra memory.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- **Binary Search on Answer Space** is ideal when finding the minimum/maximum parameter that satisfies a monotonic condition.
- **Monotonicity** guarantees that if a condition is satisfied at speed $k$, it will also be satisfied for all speeds $> k$.
- Ceiling division for positive integers $a / b$ can be computed using integer arithmetic as `(a + b - 1) / b`.
- Always check variable types for potential **integer overflow** when summing large values across many elements.
